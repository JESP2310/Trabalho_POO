It is a library system in Python, where books and users can be registered, each with their own characteristics. Users can be of two types: Professor and Student, which are classes that inherit the characteristics of the User class.

The system allows listing books, listing users, borrowing books, returning books, and listing the books each user has. It is also possible to delete a user. The difference between user types is only the limit of books each user can borrow.
